## üêö About This Project

This is a simple UNIX command-line interpreter, or shell, written in C. The shell provides a basic command-line interface for interacting with the operating system. It supports executing commands, handling arguments, and managing environment variables.

This project is a portfolio piece that demonstrates a deep understanding of C programming, operating system concepts, and system calls.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Command Execution:** The shell can execute any command found in the system's `PATH`.
*   **Argument Handling:** The shell can handle multiple arguments passed to a command.
*   **Environment Variables:** The shell can print and manage environment variables.
*   **Built-in Commands:** The shell includes a system for handling built-in commands.
*   **Custom String Functions:** The project includes custom implementations of common string manipulation functions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Programming Language:** C
*   **Compiler:** GCC
*   **Operating System:** Linux

## üöÄ Getting Started

To compile and run this shell, you will need:

*   A Linux environment.
*   The GCC compiler.

**To get started:**

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Compile the source code using GCC:
    ```bash
    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o simple_shell
    ```
3.  Run the shell:
    ```bash
    ./simple_shell
    ```
4.  You should now see a prompt and be able to enter commands.

## ü§ù Contributing

This project was a collaboration between myself and another developer. We both contributed to the design and implementation of the shell.
